WEBVTT

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.922
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.358
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.623
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, forrest!

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.007
We can talk, sir.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.886
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.968
Good god, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:43.538
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.056
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.585
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.225
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.441
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh. Hey!

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.980
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.447
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.078
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.738
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.702
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.495
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:14.506
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.804
All right.

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.231
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:22.718
Please, no gang signs.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:24.637
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.849
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.315
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:39.899
- What's going on?
“Woman: Contact left!

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:40.986
What have we got?

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.319
Jimmy, stay with stark!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.530
Stay down! Yeah.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.419
Son of a bitch!

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:57.750
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:28.708
Whoa!

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:19.547
Narrator: Tony stark.

00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.590
Visionary. Genius.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.804
American patriot.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:27.764
Even from an early age,

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.266
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard stark

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.100
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.390
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.317
At age six, his first engine.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.981
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from mit.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.317
Then, the passing of a titan.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.114
Howard stark's lifelong friend
and ally, obadiah stane,

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:55.625
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.083
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.374
and is anointed the new ceo
of stark industries.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.217
With the keys to the kingdom,

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.799
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.887
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:14.811
Today, Tony stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.935
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.020
and her interests around the globe.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.199
As liaison to stark industries,

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.290
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:39.370
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:42.039
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:46.426
to present this year's apogee award
to Mr. Tony stark.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.645
Tony?

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.149
- Thank you, colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.654
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.163
This is wonderful.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.416
Well, I'm not Tony stark.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:25.796
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:30.967
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:33.010
Tony, you know...

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.597
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.470
He's always working.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.066
Work it!

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.861
Come on!

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:51.195
We should just stay till the morning.
You are unbelievable.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.327
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.766
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.497
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.903
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.079
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.956
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.375
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.822
I don't have any of those
floating around.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.382
We're gonna let it ride!

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.328
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.467
Okay, you, too.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.372
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:21.229
There it is.
Lieutenant colonel rhodes rolls! And...

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.559
Dealer: Two craps. Line away.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.462
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.255
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.423
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.482
Tomorrow, don't be late.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.675
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.699
I know, I know.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.071
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.499
Mr. stark! Excuse me, Mr. stark!

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.127
Christine everhart,
vanity fair magazine.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.127
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.834
- She's cute.
- Tony: She's all right?

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.793
- Hi.
- Christine: Hi.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.457
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- Christine: It's okay?

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.773
You've been called
the Da Vinci of our time.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.613
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.571
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.556
"The merchant of death"?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.602
That's not bad.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.263
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.523
Well, Ms. brown,

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.689
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.175
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.319
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.660
Rehearse that much?

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.472
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.496
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.868
All I want is a serious answer.

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.537
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.793
"peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.251
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.211
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan project.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.377
A lot of people,
including your professors at brown,

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.337
would call that being a hero.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.493
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.787
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.597
by advancing medical technology

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.762
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:47.603
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.892
Wow.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.785
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.437
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.691
Jarvis on speaker:
Good morning. It's 7:00 A.M.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.048
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.468
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.008
High tide will be at 10:52 A.M.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.492
Tony?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.321
Hey, Tony?

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.518
Jarvis: You are not authorized
to access this area.

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.761
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.477
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.266
and there's a car waiting for you outside

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.275
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.648
- You must be the famous pepper potts.
- Indeed I am.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.368
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.076
I do anything and everything
that Mr. stark requires,

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.992
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.626
Will that be all?

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:48.522
Give me an exploded view.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.391
Jarvis: The compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.027
Log that.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.052
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.076
I'll keep you posted.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:03.013
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:05.403
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.934
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.727
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.037
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:12.648
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.358
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.292
before I get you out of the door.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.128
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.321
if it departs before you arrive?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.587
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson pollock in the wings.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.096
Do you want it? Yes or no.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.466
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.886
Um, no. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in east Hampton

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.270
where he lived and worked,

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:32.931
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:37.273
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.731
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:44.151
Okay.
The mit commencement speech...

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.891
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.327
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.020
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.146
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.356
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.020
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.711
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.671
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.835
I knew that. Already?

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:05.926
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:09.263
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.974
- And?
- It was very nice.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:15.561
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. stark.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.316
You're welcome, miss potts.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.564
Okay.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:44.298
Tony: You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:48.927
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.310
I got you. I got you.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:51.928
Rhodes: What's wrong with you?

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.762
- Tony: What?
- Three hours.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.771
Tony: I got caught doing a piece
for vanity fair.

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.274
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.230
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.153
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:14.036
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:16.167
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.999
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.276
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. stark.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.735
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.945
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.405
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.794
You don't respect yourself,

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.741
- so I know you don't respect me.
- Tony: I respect you.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:28.675
I'm just your babysitter.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.262
So, when you need
your diaper changed... thank you.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.518
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.269
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.750
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.560
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:39.795
Tony:
You can't have sashimi without sake.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:40.879
Rhodes: You are constitutionally

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.484
incapable of being responsible.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.259
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.283
Hot sake?

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.409
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.364
That's what I'm talking about.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.451
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.910
you know what I recognize?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:01.622
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.416
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:07.309
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.258
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:12.515
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.118
General.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.653
Welcome, Mr. stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:34.706
Thanks.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.496
Is it better to be feared or respected?

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.666
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.712
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown Jewel

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.217
of stark industries' freedom line.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.927
It's the first missile system

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.679
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:56.968
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.852
I respectfully disagree.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:03.107
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:06.269
That's how dad did it.
That's how America does it.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.984
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.572
Find an excuse

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.905
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.489
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:40.227
For your consideration, the Jericho.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:52.565
I'll be throwing one of these in

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.779
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:55.829
To peace!

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.739
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.124
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.356
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.043
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.862
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:10.886
Good night, Tony.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.342
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.131
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:20.177
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.452
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.371
What the hell did you do to me?

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.085
What I did?

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.918
What I did is to save your life.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:16.589
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.673
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:20.557
Here, want to see?

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.725
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.684
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.099
We call them the walking dead

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:35.478
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:38.489
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.608
hooked up to a car battery,

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.778
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.547
That's right. Smile.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.503
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:03.343
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:07.059
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.971
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.024
Where are we?

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.518
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:18.354
Just do as I do.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.648
Come on, put your hands up.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:24.465
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.453
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:51.725
He says, "welcome, Tony stark,
the most famous mass murderer

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:53.355
"in the history of America."

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:57.946
He is honored.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.360
He wants you to build the missile.

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.152
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.167
This one.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:16.916
I refuse.

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.102
Pepper: Tony!

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.768
He wants to know what you think.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:23.979
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.952
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.962
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:46.210
He says for you
to start working immediately,

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:48.970
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.432
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:10.993
I'm sure they're looking for you, stark.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.030
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:20.040
Look, what you just saw,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.626
that is your legacy, stark.

00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:27.710
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.469
Is that how you want to go out?

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:35.723
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony stark?

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.262
Or are you going to
do something about it?

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:43.355
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:45.404
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:47.782
Well, then,

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:51.324
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:54.157
Hmm?

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:57.326
Tony: If this is gonna be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.625
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:03.788
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:06.753
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.564
How many languages do you speak?
=a lot.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.646
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.478
They speak arabic, urdu,

00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:31.023
dari, pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:36.571
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.788
They call themselves the ten rings.

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:50.133
You know, we might be more productive

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:51.840
if you include me
in the planning process.

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:54.179
Uh-huh.

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:03.605
Okay, we don't need this.

00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:06.402
What is that?

00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:10.980
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:14.408
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:19.701
What's he doing?

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.577
Working.

00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:34.302
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:37.260
Relax. I have steady hands.

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.224
Why do you think you're still alive?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.273
- What do I call you?
- My name is yinsen.

00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:52.900
Tony: Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:55.574
Nice to meet you, too.

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.658
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:41.411
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.703
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:47.159
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:49.912
But what could it generate?

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:54.299
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:57.344
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:00.927
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:13.106
This is our ticket out of here.
What is it?

00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:15.904
Flatten them out and look.

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.029
Yinsen: Oh, wow.

00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:23.904
Impressive.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.890
Yinsen: Mmm.

00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:55.152
Good roll. Good roll.

00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:57.626
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:00.278
I'm from a small town called gulmira.

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:04.324
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:08.912
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.670
And you, stark?

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.674
- No.
- No?

00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.424
So you're a man who has everything

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:23.558
and nothing.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.893
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.515
Maybe it's been modified.

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:15.732
The tail is wrong.

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:16.736
It's just backwards.

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:03.366
Relax.

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:13.866
The bow and arrow

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:17.669
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.375
It allowed the great genghis Khan

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.637
to rule from the pacific to the Ukraine.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:30.891
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the great

00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:35.637
and four times
the size of the Roman empire.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.479
But today,

00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:44.818
whoever holds the latest stark weapons

00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.607
rules these lands.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.080
And soon,

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.665
it will be my turn.

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:10.969
Why have you failed me?

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.516
We're working.

00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:15.177
Diligently.

00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.220
I let you live.

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.395
This is how you repay me?

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:24.444
It's very complex.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.109
He's trying very hard.

00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:28.527
On his knees.

00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.863
You think I'm a fool?

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:36.915
I'll get the truth.

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:39.042
We're both working.

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:47.626
Open your mouth.

00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:48.888
What does he want?

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.342
You think I'm a fool?

00:30:55.103 --> 00:30:56.718
What's going on?

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:59.721
Tell me the truth.

00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:01.431
He's building your Jericho.

00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:06.443
What do you want? A delivery date?

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:14.820
I need him.

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:18.501
Good assistant.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.958
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:34.858
Okay? Can you move?

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.944
Okay, say it again.

00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:40.118
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:43.204
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:52.550
Where is stark?

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.841
He was here a moment ago.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.050
Go look for him.

00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:14.357
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.274
Say something.
Say something back to him.

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:18.819
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

00:33:18.872 --> 00:33:21.079
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.645
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:48.748
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:51.314
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:52.947
Okay.

00:33:53.949 --> 00:33:55.314
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.985
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:00.598
- It should be up right now.
- Yinsen: Yes.

00:34:00.622 --> 00:34:01.724
Tony:
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:03.158
- I have it.
- Press control "I."

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:06.041
=." got it.
Ly "enter." "I" and "enter."

00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:07.366
Come over here and button me up.

00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.084
Okay. All right.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:13.213
Every other hex bolt.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.342
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.923
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:21.869
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:23.053
We need more time.

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:25.681
Hey,

00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:28.980
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:31.937
Stick to the plan!

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.145
Yinsen!

00:37:27.787 --> 00:37:29.778
- Tony: Yinsen!
- Watch out!

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.180
Stark.

00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.589
Come on. We got to go.

00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:52.918
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:55.557
This was always the plan, stark.

00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:58.056
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.101
My family is dead.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.612
I'm going to see them now, stark.

00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:08.035
It's okay.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.530
I want this. I want this.

00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:20.837
Thank you for saving me.

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:26.422
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.010
Tony: My turn.

00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.531
Not bad.

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:25.055
Hey!

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:49.120
How was the "fun-vee"?

00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:27.124
Watch it, coming up here.

00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:31.747
Tony: Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.420
Hmm.

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:43.557
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:48.472
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:51.144
Where to, sir?

00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:53.047
- Take us to the hospital, please, happy.
- Tony: No.

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:54.561
No? Tony, you have to

00:42:54.614 --> 00:42:55.524
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.342
- Pepper: The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

00:42:57.366 --> 00:42:58.427
I've been in captivity for three months.

00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:01.238
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

00:43:02.622 --> 00:43:04.016
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.393
Is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.327
- Call for a press conference?
- Tony: Yeah.

00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:10.118
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:25.174
Look at this! Huh?

00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:27.560
Tony.

00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:32.769
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:34.229
Look at you!

00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:37.399
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.248
- Obadiah: You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.737
Obadiah: Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:52.581
- Miss potts?
- Yes.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.690
Can I speak to you for a moment?

00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:57.377
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

00:43:57.426 --> 00:43:58.711
I'm not a reporter.

00:43:59.053 --> 00:44:00.418
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:02.366
with the strategic homeland
intervention, enforcement

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:03.675
and logistics division.

00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:06.884
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:11.475
You know, we've been approached
already by the dod, the FBI, the CIA...

00:44:11.524 --> 00:44:15.016
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:17.856
We need to debrief Mr. stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:21.277
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.326
Uh...

00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:29.618
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.329
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:34.832
A little less formal and...

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:42.923
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:44.337
I don't know what he's up to.

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:47.632
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.095
I never got to say good-bye to dad.

00:44:50.229 --> 00:44:51.969
I never got to say good-bye to my father.

00:44:56.861 --> 00:44:58.255
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

00:44:58.279 --> 00:45:00.759
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:05.108
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

00:45:06.287 --> 00:45:10.280
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.124
I saw young Americans killed

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.424
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

00:45:23.596 --> 00:45:25.132
And I saw

00:45:26.182 --> 00:45:29.766
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:33.264
- Mr. stark!
- Hey, Ben.

00:45:33.773 --> 00:45:35.013
What happened over there?

00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:40.310
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:44.857
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:48.367
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:51.370
the weapons manufacturing division
of stark international

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:56.284
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of this company will be.

00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:57.356
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.792
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.957
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:10.090
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.550
And he's healthier than ever.

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:16.395
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.396
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:23.019
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:36.873
Well, that... that went well.

00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:39.080
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.496
Your head? What about my head?

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:45.133
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:47.919
Tony:: Optimistically, 40 points.
At minimum.

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:49.597
Yep.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.257
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:55.973
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:58.684
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

00:46:58.733 --> 00:46:59.960
It's my name on the side of the building.

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:02.646
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:03.810
Not based on what I saw.

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:06.967
We're not doing a good-enough job.

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:08.343
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.983
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:14.863
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:19.872
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.287
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:26.424
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:30.378
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.548
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:34.601
Maybe.

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:37.810
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:39.516
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:45.172
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:48.484
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or pepper.

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.773
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

00:47:59.335 --> 00:48:00.916
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:04.964
It works.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.680
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:17.012
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.267
like your father and I.

00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:20.394
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

00:48:20.439 --> 00:48:21.349
- But if I had...
- Tony.

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:25.233
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.957
- You understand me?
- That was dad's line.

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.654
You gotta let me handle this.

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:33.190
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:34.950
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

00:48:34.995 --> 00:48:38.487
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:40.368
Stark industries!

00:48:40.418 --> 00:48:43.376
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:44.752
Man: Sell, sell, sell!

00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.879
Abandon ship!

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:50.257
Does the hindenburg ring any bells?

00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:56.639
Let me show you the new
stark industries business plan!

00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:01.431
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:05.390
Tony: Pepper. How big are your hands?

00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:07.816
- What?
- Tony: How big are your hands?

00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:10.802
- I don't understand why...
- Tony: Get down here. I need you.

00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:19.456
Hey.

00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:22.984
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:25.253
Let's see them.

00:49:25.588 --> 00:49:28.045
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:30.707
I just need your help for a sec.

00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:34.293
Oh, my god, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:36.883
It was. It is now an antique.

00:49:37.558 --> 00:49:40.470
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:44.762
I'm swapping it out for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:48.253
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

00:49:48.277 --> 00:49:51.690
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.947
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.607
It's fine.

00:49:57.495 --> 00:49:59.014
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

00:49:59.038 --> 00:50:01.324
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my god!

00:50:01.373 --> 00:50:04.957
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.627
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.317
It's like operation.
You just don't let it touch

00:50:10.341 --> 00:50:11.797
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:14.321
- What do you mean, "operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:18.429
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:22.638
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:26.429
No, you're fine.
You are the most capable, qualified,

00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.182
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.526
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:35.654
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:37.402
Okay.

00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:43.659
Oh, there's pus!

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:48.326
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:50.335
- not from my body.
- It smells!

00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:51.381
Yeah, it does.

00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.665
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.558
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:59.377
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:01.618
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

00:51:01.642 --> 00:51:03.620
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:06.444
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

00:51:06.939 --> 00:51:07.849
- Oh, god!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.729
- Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:11.397
What's wrong?

00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:12.879
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:13.922
'cause you yanked it out
like a trout lure...

00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:17.313
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:19.446
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

00:51:19.535 --> 00:51:21.366
Tony? It's going to be okay.
What?

00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:22.652
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:24.741
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:29.875
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:37.504
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:39.551
Nice.

00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:41.883
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:42.932
You okay?

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.597
Don't ever, ever, ever,

00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:50.683
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

00:51:50.733 --> 00:51:52.644
I don't have anyone but you.

00:51:58.407 --> 00:51:59.407
Anyway...

00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:07.704
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:10.161
Destroy it.

00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:12.045
Incinerate it.

00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:14.293
You don't want to keep it?

00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:18.124
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:22.299
- Will that be all, Mr. stark?
- That will be all, miss potts.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.464
Hey, butterfingers, come here.

00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.933
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.811
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:34.185
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:44.533
Rhodes: The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.576
I'll tell you, in my experience,

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:51.787
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:53.284
his insight,

00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:56.624
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

00:52:56.674 --> 00:53:00.212
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.172
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:05.964
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony stark.

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:07.452
- Pilot 1: Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

00:53:07.476 --> 00:53:09.120
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:11.977
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.583
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Rhodes: Don't do that!

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:14.959
- What was his name?
- Rhodes: Don't do that.

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:15.938
- Tony: Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.474
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:18.734
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:21.179
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:26.150
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:29.070
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

00:53:29.123 --> 00:53:31.034
I'm doing a little better than walking.

00:53:31.083 --> 00:53:32.448
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:34.958
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.503
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

00:53:40.175 --> 00:53:42.837
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:45.753
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:46.841
that was a doozy.

00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:52.347
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:55.058
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:56.472
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

00:53:56.525 --> 00:54:00.564
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.146
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:08.325
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.204
Thanks.

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:21.873
- Jarvis, you up?
- Jarvis: For you, sir, always.

00:54:22.384 --> 00:54:25.922
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark il.

00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:30.844
Shall I store this on
the stark industries central database?

00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:33.277
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:36.708
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:39.223
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

00:54:43.405 --> 00:54:45.737
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.525
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:37.289
Next. Up.

00:55:37.876 --> 00:55:40.083
Not in the boot, dummy. Right here.
You got me?

00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.585
Stay put. Nice.

00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:48.001
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:50.586
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

00:55:58.063 --> 00:55:59.063
Up.

00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:01.267
Screw it. Don't even move.

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:05.142
You are a tragedy.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.162
Okay, let's do this right.

00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:20.498
Start Mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.817
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:27.456
You, roll it.

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:33.429
Okay. Activate hand controls.

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:38.955
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

00:56:38.979 --> 00:56:41.721
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.190
And three,

00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:45.318
two,

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.236
one.

00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:26.690
Up two. All right, set that.

00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:28.976
I've been buzzing you.
Didn't you hear the intercom?

00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:30.569
Yeah, everything's... what?

00:57:31.198 --> 00:57:32.938
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:35.011
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:36.035
Okay.

00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:38.806
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:39.830
It is.

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:43.949
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

00:57:48.048 --> 00:57:49.288
I didn't expect that.

00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:55.221
How'd it go?

00:57:57.891 --> 00:57:59.802
Oh. It went that bad, huh?

00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:02.763
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

00:58:02.813 --> 00:58:06.431
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.474
It would have gone better
if you were there.

00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:11.439
Uh-uh. You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:15.982
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:21.286
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:24.823
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:25.895
They're filing an injunction.

00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.001
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:29.482
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:30.461
We knew that was gonna happen.

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:32.714
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:34.875
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:37.715
Tony, the board has rights, too.

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:42.637
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:44.998
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:47.513
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.563
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:53.772
This is great.

00:58:53.822 --> 00:58:57.406
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:59.612
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:03.028
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:04.662
Something to pitch them.

00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:08.417
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

00:59:08.462 --> 00:59:10.440
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

00:59:10.464 --> 00:59:12.250
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

00:59:12.299 --> 00:59:15.041
- That's it, obie. Forget it.
- Well, this stays with me, then.

00:59:15.093 --> 00:59:17.004
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

00:59:17.054 --> 00:59:18.544
- Take two.
- Thank you.

00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:20.742
Obadiah: You mind if I come down
there and see what you're doing?

00:59:20.766 --> 00:59:21.972
Tony: Good night, obie.

00:59:22.976 --> 00:59:27.891
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:30.555
dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:33.100
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:34.563
All right, nice and easy.

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:40.069
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.031
In three, two, one.

00:59:55.801 --> 00:59:56.801
Okay.

00:59:58.178 --> 00:59:59.906
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.342
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.077
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.217
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.180
Three, two, one.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.348
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.739
Not the car, not the car!

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.032
Yikes!

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.245
Table!

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:46.757
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.947
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.579
Yeah, I can fly.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:16.916
- Jarvis, are you there?
- Jarvis: At your service, sir.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.415
- Engage heads up display.
- Check.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.708
Import all preferences
from home interface.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:22.967
Jarvis: Will do, sir.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.218
All right, what do you say?

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:34.388
Jarvis: I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.419
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.731
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.110
Do a check on control surfaces.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:42.156
As you wish.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:07.003
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:10.220
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and atc check.

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:11.849
Start listening in on ground control.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.039
Jarvis: Sir, there are still terabytes

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.349
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.562
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.445
Ready? In three, two, one.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.344
Handles like a dream.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.771
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.080
What's sr-71's record?

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.873
Jarvis: The altitude record for
fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:26.295
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.340
Jarvis: Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.057
Keep going!

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.314
Higher!

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.784
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.867
Come on, we got to break the ice!

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:38.071
Kill power.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:06.076
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:10.372
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.541
Jarvis: A very astute observation, sir.

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:14.676
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.041
we should improve the exosystems.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.929
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.092
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:25.979
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.184
- Got it?
- Yes.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.690
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.736
Thrill me.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:34.646
Reporter on TV:
Tonight's red-hot red carpet

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.985
is right here at the Disney concert hall,

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:41.369
where Tony stark's third annual benefit
for the firefighter's family fund

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.100
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.534
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.666
Jarvis:
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:48.685
Woman on TV:
Hasn't been seen in public

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:55.208
some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:59.049
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.341
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:03.633
Jarvis: The render is complete.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.223
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:09.389
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.693
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:16.070
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:21.242
The render is complete.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.903
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.618
Commencing automated assembly.

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.909
Estimated completion time is five hours.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.372
Don't wait up for me, honey.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.474
- Valet: Mr. stark.
- Tony: Thank you.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.188
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what stark industries

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.733
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.992
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:09.870
You look great, hef.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.399
Obadiah:
We're going to have a great quarter.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:16.063
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:21.385
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:22.511
I'll see you inside.

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:27.224
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.706
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:31.312
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:40.739
- Give me a scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. stark?

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.112
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.193
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.825
Strategic homeland intervention,
enforcement and logistics division.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.661
God, you need a new name for that.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.496
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:57.001
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.499
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:01.588
and time can be a factor
with these things.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.219
Let's just put something on the books.

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:06.677
How about the 24th at 7:00 P.M.
at stark industries?

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.389
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.314
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.730
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.271
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:23.010
- Are you by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?

01:09:23.034 --> 01:09:24.990
- Onh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:27.277
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.330
Yes.

01:09:28.539 --> 01:09:30.530
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.244
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:44.836
Am I making you uncomfortable?

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:51.472
Um, um, no. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:55.013
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:58.099
- You look great and you smell great.
- Pepper: Oh, god.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:00.172
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.484
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.489
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.025
What's your social security number?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.031
- Tony: Five.
- Five?

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.408
Right. Tony: Right.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.827
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.088
Tony: The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.770
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.604
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:43.235
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:44.758
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.613
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:50.151
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... people... we just danced.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:53.571
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:56.536
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:59.874
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.379
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.445
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.960
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.241
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:13.133
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.848
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.667
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.035
- I would like a vodka Martini, please.
- Okay.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:41.794
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.832
Two vodka Martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.466
Make one of them dirty, will you?

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:55.099
Wow. Tony stark.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.602
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:02.940
- Carrie.
- Christine.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:03.985
That's right.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:05.908
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.383
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.739
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.366
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:13.680
involvement in this latest atrocity.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:16.141
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:18.872
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.104
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:22.868
Is this what you call accountability?

01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:26.043
It's a town called gulmira. Heard of it?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.182
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:43.001
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.561
Well, I'm not my company.

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:48.519
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:50.884
- What's going on in gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:54.241
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.223
when they said,
"here's the line. We don't cross it.

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.657
"This is how we do business."

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.040
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:02.416
Man: Tony, your picture, please!

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:08.797
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:14.004
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.347
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.561
It was the only way I could protect you.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.766
No. No.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:39.036
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of gulmira can only be described

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:43.120
as a descent into hell,
into a modern-day heart of darkness.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.127
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.708
have been driven from their homes,

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.625
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a newfound power.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.633
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.468
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:01.884
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:10.060
Recent violence has been aftributed to a
group of foreign fighters

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.275
referred to by locals as the ten rings.

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:16.608
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.654
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.865
With no political will
or international pressure,

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:25.638
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.920
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.246
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.374
either forced to join their militia...

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.632
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:40.674
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:44.389
A child's simple question,
"where are my mother and father?"

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:48.188
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:52.193
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:26.578
Hurry it up.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:27.864
Put the women in the trucks.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.032
Stack the weapons here.

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.126
Clear all the houses.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.954
That one there.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.003
Faster. Faster.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:40.964
Grab that dog.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.049
Put him with the others.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.227
What the hell is this?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.786
Shoot this dog.

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.534
You're all incompetent.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:17.882
Turn your head!

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:25.818
Tony: He's all yours.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.072
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.324
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.034
Put me through to state.
They're going to be all over this.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:32.218
Man 1: Get those monitors up!

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:33.935
We got a bogey!

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.477
- Man 2: Wasn't air force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.375
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.185
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:41.724
It wasn't Navy. Wasn't marines.

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.393
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.778
Man 3: Negative, negative.
Man 4: Cannot identify.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:49.691
Get me colonel rhodes from
weapons development down here now!

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:58.289
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:00.075
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:02.107
Rhodes: Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.962
We got an awac
and a global hawk in the area.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.688
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:07.333
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.092
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.504
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.764
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.549
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.646
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.943
- Tony: Hello?
- Tony?

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.695
- Tony: Who's this?
- It's rhodes.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.982
- Sorry, hello?
- Rhodes: I said it's rhodes.

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:33.526
Speak up, please.
What in the hell is that noise?

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:37.367
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.826
It's funny how that works, huh?

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:42.460
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.190
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:45.954
Well, that's a hot spot.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.499
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:49.779
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:50.905
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.824
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.634
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.162
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:58.642
- Nope!
- Man: Bogey spotted!

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.541
- Major Allen: Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.897
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.726
That's my exit.

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.511
Whiplash one:
Ballroom, this is whiplash one.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.275
I've got the bogey in my sights.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:16.944
Whiplash one, what is it?

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:18.821
I've got no idea.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:19.784
Major Allen: You have radio contact?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.073
Nonresponsive, sir.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:22.286
Then you are clear to engage.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.129
Tony: Hit it.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:32.579
Whiplash two: That bogey
just went supersonic. I got a lock!

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.220
- Jarvis: Inbound missile.
- Tony: Flares!

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.688
Whiplash one:
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

01:21:58.914 --> 01:21:59.949
Deploy flaps!

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.573
Holy!

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.312
Man 1:
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:05.667
The sat visual has been lost.

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:07.703
Whiplash one: No way that's a uav.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:08.756
What is it?

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:09.882
I can't see anything.

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:12.836
Whiplash two:
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

01:22:13.554 --> 01:22:15.434
Whiplash one:
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:27.397
- Hello?
- Tony: Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.229
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.588
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.818
No, see, this isn't a game.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:35.573
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.595
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:40.486
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's Mel

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:41.819
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.603
Major Allen:
Mark your position and return to base.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.027
Whiplash one: Roger that, ballroom.

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:50.208
On your belly!

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.714
It looks like a man!

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:55.296
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:04.968
I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:07.764
Man 4: It's confirmed. He has been hit.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.553
Whiplash two: Punch out! Punch out!

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:20.946
Whiplash one down.

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:23.057
Whiplash two, do you see a chute?

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.288
Negative! No chute, no chute!

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:32.244
Whiplash one: My chute's jammed!

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.463
Whiplash two:
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.473
Whiplash two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.749
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.959
- Call off the raptors.
- That thing just took out an f-22

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.393
inside a legal no-fly zone!

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.650
Whiplash two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.152
Jarvis: You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.438
Keep going!

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.030
Whiplash one:
Good chute! Good chute!

01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:17.962
- Tony, you still there?
- Tony: Hey, thanks.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.343
Oh, my god, you crazy son of a bitch.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.865
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.846
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.540
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.055
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.478
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:35.893
Tony: Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual bs?

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.106
Rhodes: It's not that simple.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:40.485
An unfortunate training exercise

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:43.446
involving an f-22 raptor
occurred yesterday.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.821
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:51.409
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in gulmira,

01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.919
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:59.208
but I can assure you that the united
states government was not involved.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.013
Tony: Hey!

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.843
Jarvis: It is a tight fit, sir.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:09.886
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.519
Be gentle. This is my first time.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:14.306
I designed this to come off, so...

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.940
Hey.

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:20.942
- I really should be able to...
- Jarvis: Please, try not to move, sir.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.531
What's going on here?

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.807
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.456
Are those bullet holes?

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:04.116
Welcome.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.661
Compliments of Tony stark.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:14.207
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:16.288
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.165
Show me the weapon.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:23.171
Come. Leave your guards outside.

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:42.103
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.944
So this is how he did it.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.492
This is only a first, crude effort.

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:52.112
Stark has perfected his design.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.453
He has made a masterpiece of death.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.161
A man with a dozen of these
could rule all of Asia.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:02.710
And you dream of stark's throne.

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.171
We have a common enemy.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.054
If we are still in business,

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.055
I will give you these designs

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:20.818
as a gift.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:23.362
And in turn,

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:30.735
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:44.711
This is the only gift you shall receive.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:48.714
Technology.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:53.758
It's always been your achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:58.766
Don't worry.
It'll only last for 15 minutes.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.807
That's the least of your problems.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.238
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.576
All right, let's finish up here.

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:20.785
Set up sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:24.546
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.456
I want a prototype right away.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:37.225
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:39.724
I need you to go to my office.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.460
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.645
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:46.695
This'll get you in.

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:49.316
It's probably under executive files.

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.636
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.220
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:57.099
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:57.987
Same drill.

01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:00.228
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.415
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:05.089
Tony,

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.541
you know that
I would help you with anything,

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:13.678
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

01:29:13.723 --> 01:29:17.181
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:20.845
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.103
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:27.354
Is that so?

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:30.945
Well, then, I quit.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:36.030
You stood by my side all these years

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:38.365
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

01:29:38.957 --> 01:29:40.868
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.728
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:47.041
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:48.709
I shouldn't be alive,

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.129
unless it was for a reason.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:55.129
I'm not crazy, pepper.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:59.424
I just finally know what I have to do.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.523
And I know in my heart that it's right.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.865
You're all I have, too, you know.

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:39.112
Sector 167?
What are you up to, obadiah?

01:31:51.798 --> 01:31:53.914
Man:
You did not tell us that the target you

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.128
paid us to kill was the great Tony stark.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.947
- As you can see, obadiah stane...
- Oh, my god.

01:31:57.971 --> 01:32:00.804
Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.682
The price to kill Tony stark
has just gone up.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:12.016
So, what are we going to do about this?

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.526
Hmm?

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:27.493
I know what you're going through,
pepper.

01:32:35.008 --> 01:32:38.796
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:04.865
I was so happy when he came home.

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:07.620
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.163
Now I realize,

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:17.956
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:22.298
He left a part of himself in that cave.

01:33:25.225 --> 01:33:26.385
Breaks my heart.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:33.104
Well, he's a complicated person.

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:39.065
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

01:33:45.495 --> 01:33:48.612
You are a very rare woman.

01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:52.745
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:57.458
Thank you. Thanks.

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.420
I'd better get back there.

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:08.427
Is that today's paper?

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:11.854
Yes.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.560
Do you mind?

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.522
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:17.648
Of course.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:22.486
Take care.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.968
Ms. potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.258
Nope, right now. Come with me.

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:52.705
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.640
- Yep, walk with me.
- Okay.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:58.133
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:01.435
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:05.447
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:09.029
Mr. stane? Sir, we've explored

01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:11.223
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:13.203
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:17.242
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:19.502
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:26.669
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:30.555
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:37.392
Tony stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.608
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony stark.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.576
Pepper: Tony?

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:05.332
Tony, are you there? Hello?

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:08.342
Breathe.

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:12.013
Easy, easy.

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.601
You remember this one, right?

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:20.639
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:25.152
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.112
Tony.

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:35.412
When I ordered the hit on you,

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:40.162
I worried that I was

01:36:43.423 --> 01:36:45.584
killing the golden goose.

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:50.464
But, you see, it was just

01:36:51.723 --> 01:36:54.180
fate that you survived that.

01:36:59.272 --> 01:37:03.185
You had one last golden egg to give.

01:37:07.113 --> 01:37:12.528
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:21.617
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:26.038
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.715
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:45.189
Tony, this is your ninth symphony.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.606
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:52.780
This is your legacy.

01:37:55.328 --> 01:38:00.743
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:07.538
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:09.672
put the balance of power in our hands.

01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:12.796
The right hands.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:20.850
I wish you could see my prototype.

01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:23.681
It's not as...

01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:27.853
Well, not as conservative as yours.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:32.862
Too bad you had to involve pepper
in this.

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:35.273
I would have preferred that she lived.

01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:51.122
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

01:38:51.175 --> 01:38:54.133
Pepper, slow down.
Why would obadiah...

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:56.589
Okay, where's Tony now?

01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:58.319
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:00.806
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.389
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:10.587
Good boy.

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:51.628
Rhodes: Tony?

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:55.330
Tony?

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:58.385
Tony?

01:41:00.513 --> 01:41:01.513
Tony?

01:41:04.225 --> 01:41:05.225
Tony!

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:10.349
Tony! You okay?

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:14.061
- Where's pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:15.520
They're about to arrest obadiah.

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:17.645
That's not going to be enough.

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:48.517
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

01:41:57.403 --> 01:41:59.519
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:02.404
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:04.011
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:05.595
You might want to take
a few steps back.

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:27.672
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:30.762
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.225
You need me to do anything else?

01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:41.610
Tony: Keep the skies clear.

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:48.203
Damn!

01:42:56.545 --> 01:42:57.785
Next time, baby.

01:43:28.285 --> 01:43:31.823
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:33.662
I thought it'd be bigger.

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:20.211
Agent: Take him out!

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:33.160
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:35.550
Jarvis:
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

01:44:35.603 --> 01:44:38.310
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:39.470
Keep me posted.

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:42.519
Tony: Pepper!

01:44:42.568 --> 01:44:45.685
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:47.774
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

01:44:47.823 --> 01:44:49.468
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:50.902
Get out of there right now!

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.586
Obadiah:
Where do you think you're going?

01:45:10.763 --> 01:45:13.254
Your services are no longer required.

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.555
Tony: Stane!

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:42.040
Obadiah: I love this suit!

01:45:42.086 --> 01:45:45.749
Tony: Put them down!
Obadiah: Collateral damage, Tony.

01:45:47.132 --> 01:45:48.463
Tony: Divert power to chest rt.

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.304
Jarvis: Power reduced to 19%.

01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:08.987
Tony: Lady!

01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:12.400
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:46:35.014 --> 01:46:37.801
Obadiah:
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:44.227
I built this company from nothing!

01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:49.145
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:58.617
Least of all you!

01:47:07.671 --> 01:47:11.255
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:13.753
I've made some upgrades of my own!

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:24.931
Jarvis:
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.766
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

01:47:26.815 --> 01:47:29.056
Jarvis: With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.849
Tony: I know the math! Do it!

01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:41.806
Man 1: Sir, you're not going
to believe this. That thing is back.

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:43.912
Get me major Allen. Scramble the jets!

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:50.078
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.245
Yes, sir.

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:01.338
- Jarvis: Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:07.390
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

01:48:14.196 --> 01:48:16.437
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:17.490
Stop telling me!

01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:29.624
Obadiah:
You had a great idea, Tony,

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:31.706
but my suit is more advanced
in every way!

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.400
Tony:
How'd you solve the icing problem?

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:36.207
Obadiah: Icing problem?

01:48:38.637 --> 01:48:39.957
Tony: Might want to look into it.

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:53.899
Jarvis: Two percent.

01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:58.567
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

01:48:58.615 --> 01:49:00.025
Whoa!

01:49:10.627 --> 01:49:14.290
- Tony: Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my god, are you okay?

01:49:14.339 --> 01:49:16.818
Tony: I'm almost out of power. I've got
to get out of this thing.

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:17.842
I'll be right there.

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:19.218
Obadiah: Nice try!

01:49:32.608 --> 01:49:33.848
Tony: Weapons status?

01:49:34.359 --> 01:49:36.941
Jarvis:
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

01:49:40.699 --> 01:49:41.984
Flares!

01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:53.287
Obadiah: Very clever, Tony.

01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:00.708
- Potts?
- Tony!

01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:01.671
This isn't working.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.200
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.871
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

01:50:07.309 --> 01:50:09.550
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:11.247
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:13.031
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:15.504
It's going to fry everything up here.

01:50:17.528 --> 01:50:19.814
Okay. I'm going in now.

01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:23.026
Tony: Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:33.706
Tony: This looks important!

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:57.772
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:02.357
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

01:51:10.873 --> 01:51:13.239
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.496
You'd have made your father proud!

01:51:22.593 --> 01:51:24.925
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:45.736
Pepper: Tony!

01:51:47.201 --> 01:51:48.862
How ironic, Tony!

01:51:50.329 --> 01:51:55.494
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

01:51:55.542 --> 01:52:01.378
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

01:52:04.468 --> 01:52:08.632
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:13.049
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:17.185
Just do it! You'll die!

01:52:20.359 --> 01:52:21.769
Push it!

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:21.124
Pepper: Tony!

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:32.006
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

01:53:32.055 --> 01:53:33.761
at stark industries last night.

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:38.934
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

01:53:38.979 --> 01:53:41.436
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:44.794
Fortunately, a member
of Tony stark's personal security staff...

01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:46.796
"Iron man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.404
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

01:53:50.449 --> 01:53:53.065
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

01:53:53.118 --> 01:53:54.324
Here's your alibi.

01:53:55.704 --> 01:53:56.784
Okay.

01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:58.991
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

01:53:59.041 --> 01:54:01.373
We have port papers that put you
in avalon all night,

01:54:01.418 --> 01:54:03.158
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

01:54:03.211 --> 01:54:06.203
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just pepper and me

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:08.042
alone on the island.

01:54:09.468 --> 01:54:10.778
- That's what happened.
- All right.

01:54:10.802 --> 01:54:12.133
Just read it, word for word.

01:54:14.806 --> 01:54:16.126
There's nothing about stane here.

01:54:16.933 --> 01:54:19.845
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

01:54:20.604 --> 01:54:23.186
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

01:54:23.231 --> 01:54:25.768
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

01:54:25.817 --> 01:54:28.421
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

01:54:28.445 --> 01:54:30.652
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. stark.

01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:34.277
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

01:54:35.243 --> 01:54:37.404
You've got 90 seconds.

01:54:39.873 --> 01:54:41.329
Agent Coulson?

01:54:42.626 --> 01:54:46.869
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:50.167
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:53.504
- From the strategic homeland...
- Just call us s.H.L.Le.L.D.

01:54:54.096 --> 01:54:55.096
Right.

01:54:56.306 --> 01:55:00.299
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

01:55:00.352 --> 01:55:01.717
Even I don't think I'm iron man.

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:04.310
- You're not iron man.
- Am so.

01:55:04.356 --> 01:55:05.956
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

01:55:06.817 --> 01:55:10.935
You know, if I were iron man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

01:55:10.987 --> 01:55:13.716
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.026
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:19.819
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

01:55:21.706 --> 01:55:22.616
crazy about me.

01:55:22.666 --> 01:55:24.227
Tell me you never think about that night.

01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:25.707
- What night?
- You know.

01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:34.671
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:42.262
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:45.598
and you left me there, by myself?

01:55:46.648 --> 01:55:49.981
- Is that the night you're talking about?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.601
Thought so.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:58.903
- Will that be all, Mr. stark?
- Yes, that will be all, miss potts.

01:55:58.952 --> 01:56:02.661
And now, Mr. stark has
prepared a statement.

01:56:02.706 --> 01:56:05.539
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

01:56:08.837 --> 01:56:11.579
Uh, been a while
since I was in front of you.

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:13.792
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.

01:56:17.053 --> 01:56:19.893
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

01:56:19.931 --> 01:56:21.512
on the freeway and the rooftop...

01:56:21.558 --> 01:56:24.391
I'm sorry, Mr. stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

01:56:24.436 --> 01:56:28.224
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

01:56:28.273 --> 01:56:30.730
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

01:56:31.359 --> 01:56:35.102
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:38.318
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

01:56:38.366 --> 01:56:39.947
I never said you were a superhero.

01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:45.579
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

01:56:47.459 --> 01:56:50.826
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

01:56:51.338 --> 01:56:54.330
With this laundry list
of character defects,

01:56:54.382 --> 01:56:55.872
all the mistakes I've made,

01:56:55.926 --> 01:56:59.339
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

01:56:59.387 --> 01:57:01.048
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

01:57:03.099 --> 01:57:04.134
The truth is...

01:57:10.774 --> 01:57:11.809
I am iron man.

02:05:15.425 --> 02:05:16.425
Jarvis!

02:05:16.843 --> 02:05:18.504
Welcome home, sir.

02:05:21.931 --> 02:05:27.301
"I am iron man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

02:05:27.812 --> 02:05:30.929
Mr. stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

02:05:30.982 --> 02:05:32.847
You just don't know it yet.

02:05:33.443 --> 02:05:34.443
Who the hell are you?

02:05:35.486 --> 02:05:37.898
Nick fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:05:38.656 --> 02:05:39.987
An.

02:05:40.033 --> 02:05:42.524
I'm here to talk to you
about the avenger initiative.
